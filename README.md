# Sample Product Landing page template 

This project is a demonstration of the basic HTML and CSS skills I've learned as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification.

The page features a horizontal navigation bar with clickable links that lead to the corresponding sections of the landing page. The navigation bar is always on top and visible even as one scrolls down the page. There is an embedded "product" video at the center of the landing page. There is an email input field with HTML5 validation which confirms that the entered text must be an email address. 

The CSS properties used on this landing page include the use of the Flexbox model
